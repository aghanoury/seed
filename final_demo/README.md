# Final Demo
Final Demo source code. Bot did alright.

- [Arduino Control](src/Arduino/)
- [Comms](src/Comms/)
- [Computer Vision](src/Finder)

In the final demo, the bot somewhat sucessfully navigates a course laid out with 6 aruco markers. The procedures are not very smart and essentially require "just right" conditions. Still works though.
