# Solutions to Assignment 1
## Questions from Handout
1. An IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. 
Used to develop software, an IDE also offers unique and custom features for the benefit of the user's workflow
2. Exceptions can be handled with ```try/except``` statements. Example shown below
```python
try:
    "try some operation"
except: 
    "do this if it throws an error"
```

3. Define a function with
```python
def some_function(arg1, arg2,...argN):
    "Do someting"
    return
```

4. ```True```. Functions are defined with a set of inputs. Though, some of these inputs can be optional.

5. Two methods used on list objects are the ```append()``` method, for appending elements to a list.
There is also a ```reversed()``` method, which returns essentially a reversed version of a list.

6. Implementing the state machine with pointers allows more states to be dynamically added or removed.
While the if statements require hard coding states and conditions, not ideal for dynamic situations.
